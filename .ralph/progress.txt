# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2025-02-08T00:00:00Z

## Codebase Patterns
- BATS test framework with helper functions in tests/helpers/
- Test files organized in tests/ directory with subdirectories for different test types
- Fixture factory for creating test fixtures
- Helper modules: bats_helper.bash (base helpers), test_utils.bash (higher-level validators), fixture_factory.bash (test fixtures)
- Common test patterns: assertion helpers, file validation, JSON/YAML validation, plugin validation

## Current Test Structure Analysis
- 22+ BATS test files covering plugins, workflows, handoffs, and edge cases
- Helper functions spread across multiple files with some overlap
- Tests use fixture factory for creating test data
- Integration tests in tests/integration/ subdirectory
- Feature-specific tests in tests/handoff/, tests/skills/, tests/performance/

## Iteration 1 - US-007: Standardize YAML validation in bats_helper
- **Status**: Completed
- **Date**: 2026-02-08
- **Functions verified**:
  - `ensure_yaml_validator()` at bats_helper.bash:517
  - `validate_yaml_file()` at bats_helper.bash:526
- **Findings**: Both functions already exist with proper documentation comments
- **Tests verified**: All 231 tests pass
- **Learnings**:
  - PRD changed during iteration from "test-code-improvement" to "test-refactoring-iteration-2"
  - Functions may already exist even when story is marked as incomplete
  - Always verify existing code before implementing new features
  - YAML validation uses yq or python3 as fallback

## Iteration 2 - US-008: Refactor plugin_loading.bats YAML validation
- **Status**: Completed
- **Date**: 2026-02-08
- **Changes made**:
  - Added `ensure_yaml_validator()` call at test setup
  - Replaced inline yq/python3 validation with `validate_yaml_file()` call
  - Reduced code from 18 lines to 13 lines (5 lines removed)
- **File modified**: tests/integration/plugin_loading.bats:122-143
- **Tests verified**: All 231 tests pass
- **Learnings**:
  - The `ensure_yaml_validator()` function properly skips tests if neither yq nor python3 is available
  - The `validate_yaml_file()` function handles all the logic that was previously inline
  - Refactoring eliminates the nested if-elif structure for better readability
  - This pattern can be applied to other test files with inline YAML validation

## Iteration 3 - US-009: Refactor github_workflows.bats YAML validation
- **Status**: Completed
- **Date**: 2026-02-08
- **Changes made**:
  - Removed local `ensure_yq()` helper function (5 lines)
  - Replaced all 10 `ensure_yq` calls with `ensure_yaml_validator` from bats_helper
  - Replaced 3 inline YAML validation calls (`yaml_get "." >/dev/null`) with `validate_yaml_file()`
  - Updated tests: CI workflow, Release workflow, Marketplace sync workflow YAML syntax tests
  - Reduced code from 139 lines to 128 lines (11 lines removed)
- **File modified**: tests/github_workflows.bats
- **Tests verified**: All 231 tests pass
- **Learnings**:
  - Local helper functions that duplicate bats_helper functionality should be removed
  - The `ensure_yaml_validator()` is more robust than local `ensure_yq()` because it supports both yq and python3
  - All three YAML validation tests now use the standardized helper
  - Pattern is consistent across all workflow YAML validation tests
