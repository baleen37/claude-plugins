# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2025-02-08T00:00:00Z

## Codebase Patterns
- BATS test framework with helper functions in tests/helpers/
- Test files organized in tests/ directory with subdirectories for different test types
- Fixture factory for creating test fixtures
- Helper modules: bats_helper.bash (base helpers), test_utils.bash (higher-level validators), fixture_factory.bash (test fixtures)
- Common test patterns: assertion helpers, file validation, JSON/YAML validation, plugin validation

## Current Test Structure Analysis
- 22+ BATS test files covering plugins, workflows, handoffs, and edge cases
- Helper functions spread across multiple files with some overlap
- Tests use fixture factory for creating test data
- Integration tests in tests/integration/ subdirectory
- Feature-specific tests in tests/handoff/, tests/skills/, tests/performance/

## Iteration 1 - US-007: Standardize YAML validation in bats_helper
- **Status**: Completed
- **Date**: 2026-02-08
- **Functions verified**:
  - `ensure_yaml_validator()` at bats_helper.bash:517
  - `validate_yaml_file()` at bats_helper.bash:526
- **Findings**: Both functions already exist with proper documentation comments
- **Tests verified**: All 231 tests pass
- **Learnings**:
  - PRD changed during iteration from "test-code-improvement" to "test-refactoring-iteration-2"
  - Functions may already exist even when story is marked as incomplete
  - Always verify existing code before implementing new features
  - YAML validation uses yq or python3 as fallback
