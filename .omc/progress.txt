## Codebase Patterns

### Release Workflow Analysis
- **File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Issue**: Line 15 has `if: ${{ !contains(github.actor, '[bot]') }}` which prevents bot-triggered workflows
- **Symptom**: Recent release PRs (#227, #228) show "skipped" status
- **Root Cause**: When semantic-release creates a release PR, the commit is made by github-actions[bot]. When this bot-created PR is pushed, the workflow sees `[bot]` in the actor and skips execution.

### Current Flow (Broken)
1. User pushes to main → Release workflow runs (not a bot)
2. semantic-release creates release branch + PR
3. PR is created with `--auto --squash` merge
4. GitHub merges the PR (creates merge commit on main)
5. **Problem**: Merge commit triggers release workflow again, but actor is github-actions[bot] → workflow skips

### Semantic Release Config
- `.releaserc.js` uses `@semantic-release/github` plugin
- Creates release PRs with version bumps
- Publishes releases to GitHub

### Branch Protection Rules (Need to Check)
- May affect auto-merge behavior
- Required status checks?
- Required reviewers?
