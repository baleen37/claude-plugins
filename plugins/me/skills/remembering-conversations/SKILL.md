# Remembering Conversations

Search conversation history to find past decisions, patterns, and failed approaches before reinventing.

## Core Principle

**Search before reinventing.** Searching costs nothing; reinventing or repeating mistakes costs everything.

## When to Use

**After understanding the task:**

- User asks "how should I..." or "what's the best approach..."
- After exploring codebase, need to make architectural decisions

**When stuck:**

- Investigated a problem, can't find solution
- Need to follow unfamiliar workflow

**Historical signals:**

- User says "last time", "before", "we discussed"
- User asks "why did we...", "do you remember..."

**Don't search first:**

- For current codebase structure (use Grep/Read)
- For info in current conversation
- Before understanding the task

## 3-Layer Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this workflow to save 10x tokens:**

### 1. Search for Index

`mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__search`

- Get lightweight index with observation IDs
- Params: `query`, `limit`, `dateStart`, `dateEnd`

### 2. Get Context

`mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__timeline`

- Get context around interesting results
- Params: `query` or `anchor`, `depth_before`, `depth_after`

### 3. Fetch Details

`mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__get_observations`

- Fetch ONLY filtered IDs from steps 1-2
- Params: `ids` (required array)

**NEVER fetch full details without filtering first.**

## Strategy

1. Search broad: `{ query: "authentication" }`
2. Review index results
3. Get timeline context for interesting IDs
4. Fetch full details for most relevant observations
5. Synthesize: key insights, apply to context, recommend approach

## Extract

- Past decisions and rationale
- Failed approaches and why
- Successful patterns
- Gotchas and edge cases

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I know this topic, I'll just answer" | General knowledge ≠ project-specific context. Search first. |
| "One search failed, no history exists" | Try different queries, date ranges, broader terms before giving up. |
| "Quick question, skip the search" | Searching takes seconds. Reinventing wastes minutes. |
| "I need the skill to search" | MCP search tools are always available. Skill teaches WHEN to use them. |
