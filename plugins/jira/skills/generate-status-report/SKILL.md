# Generate Status Report

## Keywords
status report, project status, weekly update, daily standup, Jira report, project summary, blockers, progress update, sprint report, project update, team status, issue analysis, priority report, completion report

Automatically query Jira for project status, analyze issues, and generate formatted status reports.

**CRITICAL**: This skill should be **interactive**. Always clarify scope (time period, audience) with the user before or after generating the report.

## Workflow

Generating a status report follows these steps:

1. **Identify scope** - Determine project, time period, and target audience
2. **Query Jira** - Fetch relevant issues using JQL queries
3. **Analyze data** - Categorize issues and identify key insights
4. **Format report** - Structure content based on audience and purpose
5. **Deliver report** - Present or save the report

## Step 1: Identify Scope

**IMPORTANT**: If the user's request is missing key information, ASK before proceeding with queries.

Clarify these details:

**Project identification:**
- Which Jira project key? (e.g., "PROJ", "ENG", "MKTG")
- If the user mentions a project by name but not key, search Jira to find the project key

**Time period:**
- If not specified, ask: "What time period should this report cover? (default: last 7 days)"
- Options: Weekly (7 days), Daily (24 hours), Sprint-based (2 weeks), Custom period

**Target audience:**
- If not specified, ask: "Who is this report for? (Executives/Delivery Managers, Team-level, or Daily standup)"
- **Executives/Delivery Managers**: High-level summary with key metrics and blockers
- **Team-level**: Detailed breakdown with issue-by-issue status
- **Daily standup**: Brief update on yesterday/today/blockers

## Step 2: Query Jira

Use the `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` tool to fetch issues. Build JQL queries based on report needs.

### Common Query Patterns

For comprehensive queries, use the `scripts/jql_builder.py` utility to programmatically build JQL strings. For quick queries, reference `references/jql-patterns.md` for examples.

**All open issues in project:**
```jql
project = "PROJECT_KEY" AND status != Done ORDER BY priority DESC, updated DESC
```

**Issues updated in last week:**
```jql
project = "PROJECT_KEY" AND updated >= -7d ORDER BY priority DESC
```

**High priority and blocked issues:**
```jql
project = "PROJECT_KEY" AND (priority IN (Highest, High) OR status = Blocked) AND status != Done ORDER BY priority DESC
```

**Completed in reporting period:**
```jql
project = "PROJECT_KEY" AND status = Done AND resolved >= -7d ORDER BY resolved DESC
```

### Query Strategy

For most reports, execute multiple targeted queries rather than one large query:

1. **Completed issues**: Get recently resolved tickets
2. **In-progress issues**: Get active work items
3. **Blocked issues**: Get blockers requiring attention
4. **High priority open**: Get critical upcoming work

Use `maxResults: 100` for initial queries. If pagination is needed, use `nextPageToken` from results.

### Data to Extract

For each issue, capture:
- `key` (e.g., "PROJ-123")
- `summary` (issue title)
- `status` (current state)
- `priority` (importance level)
- `assignee` (who's working on it)
- `created` / `updated` / `resolved` dates
- `description` (if needed for context on blockers)

## Step 3: Analyze Data

Process the retrieved issues to identify:

**Metrics:**
- Total issues by status (Done, In Progress, Blocked, etc.)
- Completion rate (if historical data available)
- Number of high priority items
- Unassigned issue count

**Key insights:**
- Major accomplishments (recently completed high-value items)
- Critical blockers (blocked high priority issues)
- At-risk items (overdue or stuck in progress)
- Resource bottlenecks (one assignee with many issues)

**Categorization:**
Group issues logically:
- By status (Done, In Progress, Blocked)
- By priority (Highest -> Low)
- By assignee or team
- By component or epic (if relevant)

## Step 4: Format Report

Select the appropriate template based on audience. Templates are in `references/report-templates.md`.

### For Executives and Delivery Managers

Use **Executive Summary Format**:
- Brief overall status (Green On Track / Yellow At Risk / Red Blocked)
- Key metrics (total, completed, in progress, blocked)
- Top 3 highlights (major accomplishments)
- Critical blockers with impact
- Upcoming priorities

**Keep it concise** - 1-2 pages maximum. Focus on what matters to decision-makers.

### For Team-Level Reports

Use **Detailed Technical Format**:
- Completed issues listed with keys
- In-progress issues with assignee and priority
- Blocked issues with blocker description and action needed
- Risks and dependencies
- Next period priorities

**Include more detail** - Team needs issue-level visibility.

### For Daily Updates

Use **Daily Standup Format**:
- What was completed yesterday
- What's planned for today
- Current blockers
- Brief notes

**Keep it brief** - This is a quick sync, not comprehensive analysis.

## Step 5: Deliver Report

Present the formatted report to the user and offer options for delivery:
- Display in chat for review
- Save as a file for distribution
- Format for copy-paste into other tools

## Complete Example Workflow

**User request:** "Generate a status report for Project Phoenix"

**Step 1 - Identify scope:**
- Project: Phoenix (need to find project key)
- Time period: Last week (default)
- Audience: Not specified, assume executive level

**Step 2 - Query Jira:**
```python
# Find project key first
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql(
    cloudId="...",
    jql='project = "PHOENIX" OR project = "PHX"',
    maxResults=1
)

# Query completed issues
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql(
    cloudId="...",
    jql='project = "PHX" AND status = Done AND resolved >= -7d',
    maxResults=50
)

# Query blocked issues
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql(
    cloudId="...",
    jql='project = "PHX" AND status = Blocked',
    maxResults=50
)

# Query in-progress high priority
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql(
    cloudId="...",
    jql='project = "PHX" AND status IN ("In Progress", "In Review") AND priority IN (Highest, High)',
    maxResults=50
)
```

**Step 3 - Analyze:**
- 15 issues completed (metrics)
- 3 critical blockers (key insight)
- Major accomplishment: API integration completed (highlight)

**Step 4 - Format:**
Use Executive Summary Format from templates. Create concise report with metrics, highlights, and blockers.

**Step 5 - Deliver:**
Present the formatted report and ask if user wants to save or modify it.

## Tips for Quality Reports

**Be data-driven:**
- Include specific numbers and metrics
- Reference issue keys directly
- Show trends when possible (e.g., "completed 15 vs 12 last week")

**Highlight what matters:**
- Lead with the most important information
- Flag blockers prominently
- Celebrate significant wins

**Make it actionable:**
- For blockers, state what action is needed and from whom
- For risks, provide mitigation options
- For priorities, be specific about next steps

**Keep it consistent:**
- Use the same format for recurring reports
- Maintain predictable structure
- Include comparable metrics week-over-week

**Provide context:**
- Link to Jira for details
- Explain the impact of blockers
- Connect work to business objectives when possible
